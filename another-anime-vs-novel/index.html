<p>If you really want to jump straight in though the anime ends around Chapter 70 of the WN and around halfway through chapter 2 in volume 3 of the LN. The anime was meh. In the novels the woman who was Kirinos editor in the anime is actually a failed novelist herself who steals Kirinos work and passes it off as her own. The WN and LN are pretty close where most of the changes in the LN are simply extra side-stories. The main light novel ends at Ryuuji beginning his third year of high school and meeting Taiga along his way to school while the anime ends at their high school graduation and then meeting Taiga in one of the classroom.</p>

<p>Specific plot points later on are influenced by the number of students in class. See all manga tags. I felt the novel to be a lot more real and enjoyable than the anime. Here are some of the differences beware of spoilers. Misaki and Mei are pushed back.</p>

<p>Even considering Our Last Crusade which has volumes not that big. The routes in the visual novel spread out. All Votes Add Books To This List. Bungo Stray Dogs Gaiden. The English hardback is decent I show it off quite a bit here although I did notice that holding it unprotec.</p>
