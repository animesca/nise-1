I need one with a good animation, awesome story plot and a good looking guys and girls ;) and please don`t suggest any anime that is the opposite of what i just said. I’d have to say 3 romances in anime tie for me and that’s the romances in toradara, nisekoi which is soooo good but for some reason in the anime’s second season the didn’t do the episodes in the order the chapters went so you start to feel like it won’t happen but honestly the anime and manga is so addictive. The romance in this anime is subtle, yet harmonizes perfectly with the rest of the show. I really need a good anime this time ! The anime stays true to its slice of life and the shoujo tag.</p>
