<p>You can watch most of the anime for free after the day of airing. I have a friend in japan and he mentioned both are not available to use in japan probably bc of licensing troubles or something. This is among the best apps to watch anime for free on our list. While you know of your standard places (crunchyroll, hulu), there are always small ones that just so happen to air the anime you might want to watch (like crackle, to an extent). It is fair enough to say that netflix doesn’t have the whole world collection of anime, but you can find some decent movies here for sure.</p>
