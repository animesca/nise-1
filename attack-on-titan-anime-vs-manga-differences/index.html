The transformation is slightly different than in the manga as in the film the Titan body forms around the human whereas in the movie the Titan body forms out of the wound. I remember reading AoT when it was rising in popularity back in 2013 but dismissed it because it was meh. A few days back Attack on Titan mangas final chapter leaked online. However when I watched season 1 in 2017 it blew my mind.</p>

<p>Its the better half and has the best episodes in the series. Attack on Titan anime vs manga. Let me point out some of them for you. By which I mean that its content thats better animated than it is in the manga. Well in the last episode there is a VERY significant different between the two at the end.</p>

<p>I think AoT is an unique example of anime manga so far. While the Shingeki no Kyojin manga has yet to wrap up the anime is just about to. With Cristal Marie. I remember reading AoT when it was rising in popularity back in 2013 but dismissed it because it was meh. Yes the manga is more detailed but the anime literally covers an entire volume in 1 episode.</p>

<p>Well in the last episode there is a VERY significant different between the two at the end. In the movie Eren mentions that he barely remembers his. Hey guys i was just wondering if i should continue reading Attack on Titan. The painfully awkward Mikasa of the film as played by Kiku Mizuhara is really very different from the cool and confident Mikasa of the anime. While the Shingeki no Kyojin manga has yet to wrap up the anime is just about to.</p>
