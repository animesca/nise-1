I own the volumes and I will encourage people. The original anime is an experiance through Annos mind during he time he created it and thats one of the main reasons its so highly regarded. The anime starts to stray from the source material in Episode 26 or volume 9 chapter 72 in the manga.</p>

<p>-The Manga is much more funnier for me than the anime. In the manga we see Tross being breached before getting a very long fl. That makes me embarrassed all the time and i stopped watching. Anime has more action or more movement when compared to manga. Anime is related to animation whereas manga is related to comics.</p>

<p>-The Manga has 99 chapters while the anime has 24 episodes. The only thing i dont like is the characters are soo sexy. It tells the overall same story as the anime but at the same time is very different. I say anime is better as it has more realism to it and has voices that fit the characters. A single issue of a manga can be written drawn and inked within a single week.</p>

<p>I say anime is better as it has more realism to it and has voices that fit the characters. It isnt part of his internal monologue because it isnt a secret. Sharona Elly Sally Milly and Lilly are not in the manga. For the earlier arcs the anime actually closely follows the manga and theres not much difference there. It seems the manga is still running but im not sure if that is ending soon or if the.</p>
