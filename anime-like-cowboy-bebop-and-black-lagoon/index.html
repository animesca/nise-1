<p>Cowboy Bepop was a passion project for most of the crew and that certainly resulted in the show being one of the most unique and most intriguing anime series ever. It takes the gunplay up a notch and is full of plentiful Hollywood references. The characters in this series are amazing and just like in Cowboy Bebop they are rich with both positive and negative traits which make them so alive. Here are some good psychological thriller anime the only genres I follow really. Desert Punk Sunabouzu MAL. Similar style same director and a lot the same cast.</p>

A haven for convicts and degenerates alike the city is notorious for being the center of illegal activities and operations often fueled by local. A slick reinvention of a classic anime series.
