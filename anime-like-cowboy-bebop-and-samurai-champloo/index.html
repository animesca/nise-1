<p>Well from a technical standpoint Samurai Champloo wins pretty easily. STORY - Like its predecessor Cowboy Bebop Samurai Champloo is a very episodic series and its perfectly safe to miss a few episodes here or there. Dunno why I havent seen it before. If those arent enough similarities both are directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. - Little Witch Academia Made by the same studio.</p>

<p>Again youll love the similar animation style gr. Both anime series have some classic comedy bits within them with Ed being the standout star of Cowboy Bebop. Cowboy Bebop is space bounty hunters set to a mostly jazz soundtrack while Samurai Champloo is samurai set to a hip-hop soundtrack. Set in the near-future Megalobox is about Junk Dog a young man who fights in rigged. If those arent enough similarities both are directed by Shinichiro Watanabe.</p>

<p>After all its newer and its budget is bigger. Youll appreciate the animation execution story fresh approach and lack of cliches - Darling In The Franxx Produced by both Trigger and A1 Pictures. Cowboy Bebop Samurai Champloo shares similar settings even though one is about samurai and the other about sci fi. In contrast to Cowboy Bebops futuristic setting Samurai Champloo goes a bit more old schoolSet during an alternate version of Japans Edo-era which lasted from 1608-1868 this heavily hip-hop-infused anime series follows vagrant swordsman Mugen composed ronin Jin and Fuu a girl on a quest to find a samurai who smells of sunflowersThe series despite a very different setting is. Funny that Im actually just watching Cowboy Bebop.</p>

<p>Funny that Im actually just watching Cowboy Bebop. If those arent enough similarities both are directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. Other than that I really dont know. Even the overarching story remains incredibly vague for almost the entirety of the series and the audience is sometimes left to wonder if there really is a point to all of that searching when they knew virtually nothing to begin with.

<p>They are built on a similar premise. Youll appreciate the animation execution story fresh approach and lack of cliches - Darling In The Franxx Produced by both Trigger and A1 Pictures. STORY - Like its predecessor Cowboy Bebop Samurai Champloo is a very episodic series and its perfectly safe to miss a few episodes here or there. Mugen Jin and Fuu are not so dissimilar from the Bebop crew and the juxtaposition of samurai and hip-hop music is similar to what Bebop does with space and jazz. Funny that Im actually just watching Cowboy Bebop.</p>
